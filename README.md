# xkeysyms

This crate provides constants representing all of the X11 keyboard symbols. It also provides utility functions for working with those symbols, and for converting between keyboard codes and keyboard symbols. This crate does not depend on a particular implementation of the X11 protocol and can therefore be used in any context where X11 keyboard symbols are needed.

In addition, this crate contains no unsafe code and is fully compatible with `no_std` environments.
